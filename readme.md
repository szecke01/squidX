## Squid for Everyone!

### About
This is the open-source C# [(mono)](http://www.mono-project.com/) implementation 
of Squid, a twin-stick [shmup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up) I 
developed a few years ago with a [friend](http:/stevegregory.me). You may 
remember it from its tenure as an Xbox360
[gem](https://www.engadget.com/2011/02/25/xbox-live-indie-gems-squid/). This
project takes on a new life every couple of years as a way to learn a new
platform or language by porting it &mdash; to spread the love, it's here on
github so anyone can use it to get started making their own game.

### Premise
You are Squid &mdash; a cargo shuttle trapped in a space warzone! With no
weapons to speak of, the only option you have is to outmaneuver your enemies
by redirecting enemy fire back into them. Supporting up to 4-player local
co-op, stay alive as long as you can to rack up the high score.

### Requirements & Setup

Originally built with XNA 3.0, this port uses on Mono 5.8 with
[Monogame](http://www.monogame.net/) 3.6. YMMV on a given operating system,
but for Debian based linux such as Ubuntu, you'll need the following to develop

* mono-complete
* libopenal-dev
* referenceassemblies-pcl 

----
sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev 
sudo apt-get install mono-runtime
sudo apt-get install referenceassemblies-pcl

----

You'll also need Monodevelop 6 specifically for Monogame 3.6, so grab it:

----
wget https://github.com/cra0zy/monodevelop-run-installer/releases/download/6.2.0.1778-1/monodevelop-6.2.0.1778-1.run
chmod +x monodevelop-6.2.0.1778-1.run
sudo ./monodevelop-6.2.0.1778-1.run
----

And finally monogame itself:

----
wget http://www.monogame.net/releases/v3.6/monogame-sdk.run
chmod +x monogame-sdk.run
sudo ./monogame-sdk.run
----
