## Squid for Everyone!

### About
This is the open-source C# [(mono)](http://www.mono-project.com/) implementation 
of Squid, a twin-stick [shmup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up) I 
developed a few years ago with a friend. You may remember it from its tenure as 
an Xbox360
[gem](https://www.engadget.com/2011/02/25/xbox-live-indie-gems-squid/). This
project takes on a new life every couple of years as a way to learn a new
platform or language by porting it &mdash; to spread the love, it's here on
github so anyone can use it to get started making their own game.

### Premise
You are Squid &mdash; a cargo shuttle trapped in a space warzone! With no
weapons to speak of, the only option you have is to outmaneuver your enemies
by redirecting enemy fire back into them. Supporting up to 4-player local
co-op, stay alive as long as you can to rack up the high score.
